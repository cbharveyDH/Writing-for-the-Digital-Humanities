# About Me

## by Claire Harvey

My name is Claire Harvey and I’m currently working towards my BA in Communication Studies and Minors in Digital Humanities, Graphic Design, and Dance at Christopher Newport University (CNU).

I chose to study Communication Studies because it allows me to think critically, apply business knowledge and techniques, and it is versatile. Communication Studies is a growing department, as communication is something we use every day. My focus in this area of study is Media focused, meaning I’m studying how and why media platforms and advertisements impact an audience. For example, an advertisement about Diet Coke may or may not make you crave a cold Diet Coke. I’m studying how and why this ad would make you feel a certain way. 

I’m taking the course ENGL 350 Writing for the Digital Humanities because I’m a DH minor, but also because the skills we are learning in this class are so important. This course does fulfill a Writing Intensive requirement, but this class teaches you how to blog, code on GitHub, and grant writing. I hope this class will help me become a better writer and have a better understanding of defining DH.

I love studying at CNU because of the small class sizes, the opportunities that are offered through the Career Center, and it’s a beautiful campus. 

I’m involved with the Art Club, Photography Club, and the Theatre & Dance Department. I am also a member of the Gamma Phi Beta Sorority where I serve as Academic Chairwoman. I love being involved with these clubs and organizations because I can meet new people and am challenged to be the best version of myself.

After I finish my Undergraduate Degree at CNU, I hope to never stop learning. I’m not sure about my time frame, but I want to continue learning and attend Graduate School. I also want to travel, especially to Greece. I want to do so many things and study so many areas of interest at school or in communities. 

Although I have a strenuous bucket list, my “end goal” for my career is to live in New York. I love performing and inspiring others, so I would like to take time to just audition and get myself out there. Based on my area of study, I would like to work with Playbill, a theatre magazine, or marketing firms in Times Square. Of course I have to do more research, but I want to explore my options and relate my work/job to the arts!

Throughout my life, I’ve worked with multiple professional and community theatre production companies. Most recently, I worked with [Endstation Theatre Company](https://www.endstationtheatre.org), a professional theatre company based in Lynchburg, VA (also my hometown!). 

This past summer of 2022, I performed in Endstation’s production of “_Bye Bye Birdie._” This show was truly a dream come true for me. I watched this movie with Ann Margret as Kim McAfee and fell in love with the show. This show is one of the reasons why I love performing and theatre in general.

I’ve worked with Endstation Theatre Company for many years. The company has a Summer camp called "_Embark!_", that allows underserved youth in the community to explore the arts. I was once a student for this camp when I was in Elementary and Middle school.

(This picture was approved to use as I posted it other places during the time I was a Junior Teacher of "_Embark!_" Summer 2021.)

I have performed at their annual fundraising Gala to help raise money specifically for "_Embark!_" I’ve had the opportunity to be a Musical Theatre (MT) Teacher Assistant (Summer 2020 "_Embark!_" Virtual) and a MT Junior Teacher (Summer 2021) for this camp. This was a rewarding experience because I watched each age group grow not just as performers but also as people. 

During the summer of 2021, I was also a Marketing/Box Office Intern for Endstation. I worked with one of the Creative Directors and he introduced me to media/marketing platforms, such as MailChimp, Squarespace, and a few others. 

This internship allowed me to really focus on the business side of the arts and it connected me with future opportunities. I now work at a store called [Paisley Gift and Stationary](https://paisleygiftslynchburg.com/) and I design their website and monthly newsletters.

I’m looking forward to continuing studying and am excited to see myself grow as a person and as a writer, so stay tuned!
