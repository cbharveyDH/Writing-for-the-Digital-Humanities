#### _Project Summary_ 
_Southern Mosaic_ is a digital humanities (DH)  project focusing on John Lomax’s, Texas Folklore Society founding member, recording expeditions of American ballads and folklore music. Lomax traveled all over the South and visited Southern prison farms recording work songs, reels, ballads, and blues from prisoners which are defined as an isolated musical culture. Ruby Terrill, Lomax’s wife, composed all written documentation relating to the collection, cataloged the contents of each disc, transcribed song lyrics and composed nearly 307 pages of field notes. John Lomax consumed the knowledge of material he was seeking and ruby Lomax consumed the organization and archival skills of the material needed for the project. 

The project director, Aditya Jain, aims for this project is to inform the reader of the journey and research John and Ruby Lomax studied during their recording expedition as well as introduce an isolated Southern musical culture. .


#### _Design of Project_
The design of this project involves the use of scrolling down rather than hitting a “Next” button or box. Compared to other DH projects I’ve looked at in previous DH classes, I’m used to seeing a more interactive user experience. The project design provides visuals and sound audio which allows the user to fully dive into the history, gain a personal connection to the people directing the project, and travel with the Lomax’s through their recording expedition.

This project also includes an interactive map that shows where the Lomax’s traveled and where certain music recordings took place.

I really enjoyed this interactive image of the project because it allows the viewer to visualize where songs and research took place. As the map takes you through the recording expedition journey, captions pop up with information about what was recorded at that spot. The captions are challenging to read at points because they tend to go very fast. The design of the project shows this image first and then goes more in depth about the Lomax’s recording expedition and their sound recordings.

#### _Relevance of Project_
The project utilizes interactive technology and sound to transcribe the challenging aspects of this project. The project director is very knowledgeable within the field of history and music, as this project focuses on the southern musical culture and history of American folklore and ballads. This project relates to our class, Writing for the Digital Humanities, because it offers a different perspective on DH projects and different formatting skills, such as scrolling rather than clicking through a story. 


#### _Credits of Project and Writer_
The Acknowledgments section for this project is brief. The project director credits specific individuals that helped them with this project. Images and visual aids were supplied by the LC Labs, the Library Congress. Music audios and samples were contributed by the American Folklife Center.
