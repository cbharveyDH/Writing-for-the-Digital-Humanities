#### _Project Summary_ 
“_Southern_ Mosaic_”  is a digital humanities (DH)  project focusing on John Lomax’s, Texas Folklore Society founding member, recording expeditions of American ballads and folklore music. Lomax traveled all over the South and visited Southern prison farms recording work songs, reels, ballads, and blues from prisoners which are defined as an isolated musical culture. Ruby Terrill, Lomax’s wife, composed all written documentation relating to the collection, cataloged the contents of each disc, transcribed song lyrics and composed nearly 307 pages of field notes. John Lomax consumed the knowledge of material he was seeking and ruby Lomax consumed the organization and archival skills of the material needed for the project. 

The project director, Aditya Jain, aims for this project is to inform the reader of the journey and research John and Ruby Lomax studied during their recording expedition as well as introduce an isolated Southern musical culture.


#### _Design of Project_
The design of this project involves the use of scrolling down rather than hitting a “Next” button or box. Compared to other DH projects I’ve looked at in previous DH classes, I’m used to seeing a more interactive user experience. The project design provides visuals and sound audio which allows the user to fully dive into the history, gain a personal connection to the people directing the project, and travel with the Lomax’s through their recording expedition.

This project also includes an interactive map that shows where the Lomax’s traveled and where certain music recordings took place.

I really enjoyed this interactive image of the project because it allows the viewer to visualize where songs and research took place. As the map takes you through the recording expedition journey, captions pop up with information about what was recorded at that spot. There are occasional formatting issues with the timing, as the captions tend to go very fast or very slow which makes it challenging for viewers to read the information. The design of the project shows this image first and then goes more in depth about the Lomax’s recording expedition and their sound recordings.


#### _Relevance of Project_
The project utilizes interactive technology and sound to transcribe the challenging aspects of this project. The project director is very knowledgeable within the field of history and music, as this project focuses on the southern music culture and history of American folklore and ballads. It shows how music was created during that time period and also relates how music is created today. This project relates to our class, Writing for the Digital Humanities, because it offers a different perspective on DH projects and different formatting skills, such as scrolling rather than clicking through a story. _Southern Mosaic_ really focuses on an undiscovered area of music and ties in the history of American culture during the 1930s-1940s.


#### _Credits of Project and Writer_
The Acknowledgments section for this project is brief. The project director credits specific individuals that helped them with this project. Images and visual aids were supplied by the LC Labs, the Library Congress. Music audios and samples were contributed by the American Folklife Center.

#### _Project Findings and Review_ 
_Southern Mosaic_ is a very interesting project, as it merges history, music, and technology into one while also making it user-friendly. I really enjoyed being able to listen to small snippets of music recorded and the story behind the different and various songs. Because these recordings were taken many years ago, the recordings are a little rough and challenging to understand exactly what the words are being sung. Each music clip varies in length and shows a variety of different types of songs. 

The formatting and organization of this project is challenging to read because there is a ton of information. The Lomax’s traveled to Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, and Washington, D.C. Each area they traveled had very detailed descriptions, images, and audio sound music recordings. The research was very in depth, but because there was so much information it might be easier to navigate these states' history if there were links separating them. Adding additional links or sections to navigate an individual state would be easier to read. It could also be beneficial to have more visuals throughout the project of a map like the first one, but only focusing on one state at a time. 

Aside from the organization, this project provides really interesting photographs of singers and musicians along with their recordings. Texas had the most data and visual aid. I really enjoyed reading about all of the personal stories and the personal connections each singer had to their songs. Texas offered the most variety of music and I liked how the project director included graphs showing recordings and data divided into 4 sections: recordings, people, locations, and state.

The graphs for each state studied was really helpful to tie together all the recordings with the information projects. 

Overall, _Southern Mosaic_ is informative and a really strong DH project. I feel like it allows viewers to engage with the information given and written while also listening to music. This project teaches viewers about an isolated musical culture while also being interactive.
