**Project Summary**

_Universe Within_ is a digital, interactive documentary that exposes the hidden digital lives of high rise residents around the world. This project and story takes us on a journey through the minds and computers of three vertical citizens around the world from Guangzhou, Mumbai, and New York. 

The director of the project, Katerina Cizek, focuses on the questions of “how do we engage with our loved ones over the worldwide web” and “how has it rewired our brains and our relationships.” The audience is confronted with controversial questions about ethics, emotions, and empathy when it comes to our digital, vertical environments.

**Design of Project**

At the bottom of the project page, the viewer has the option to click through informative tabs about the project. Compared to other projects I’ve looked at, having multiple tabs such as “About”, “Director’s Statement”, “Tech”, etc. is really helpful in understanding what the project is and how it works. After clicking on the “Tech” tab, I am able to see the technology used behind the project. The project director, tech and creative teams used still cameras, video cameras, audio recorders, 3D-video capturing systems, video-editing tools, and other web technologies. 

When you first enter the main page of this project, you see a city with three people bigger than the highrise city buildings. Each time you move your mouse across the screen the perspective changes in direction. The three people give a quick two-line audio sentence about themselves when waiting on the main page.

The viewer has the option to click on one of the three people at a time. First, I chose to click on the little girl.

She is created by the internet, describing herself as a digital native. The design of this project includes visuals and audios that narrate the entire interactive documentary. In order to follow the design of the project, you have to have your volume on. The digital character has 4 sections. The first section is a summary of who the character is. They then ask a question, as you can see with the picture above, and you are given a few options to click on. I clicked on “Save your friends lives” which then took me deeper into the documentary. A true story was being told by a middle aged woman who had created her own hashtag movement. When clicking on different options, a 3-5 minute recorded video of a true story related to the topic is told by a real person. 

One thing I thought was really interesting about the design of the project was a world-view map was shown right before the section ended. The viewer is asked to estimate their location on a map. Then it creates a “spider-web” of all the potential connections you could have all over the world just from being connected through the internet.

At the end of the sections, a short summary of the social movement is shared. Then you are taken back to the main page of the three people hovering above the high rise city. The other two people are designed the same way as the first person I clicked on. The other two people had different social movements, but the design of the interactive documentary was the same as the first. 

**Relevance of Project**

This project is relevant to Abbey and I’s grant proposal project idea because of the layout of the digital documentary aspect. The topic of this project does not pertain to the topic of our idea, which is about Alzheimer’s disease, but the organization and digital performance of the project relate exactly to how we want our project to look. The tab “Tech” describes all the digital platforms used as well as links to the websites. For example, _Universe Within_ used DepthKit, which is an open-source software that captures photographic data in three dimensions, combining the languages of photography and data visualization. When looking at the project the “digital natives,” which are the interactive 3D cloud avatars speaking, are created by this software. Our project will also use DepthKit to perform something very similar as _Universe Within_ digital natives. 

**Project Findings and Review**

Other than just enjoying the unique take on this project, I find it slightly challenging to follow and to go back and forth from avatar to avatar. This project has a difficult topic to cover and lots of choices can be made. For example, each avatar asks multiple questions and is given many choices to make, but if you choose one answer you cannot hit the back button to click something else. You have to start from the very beginning of the storyline again.

Since I started with the little girl, I’ll talk about her. As we begin the girl talks a little about herself and what the internet means to her. Then, the girl asks you the question “What kind of movement would you start through a hashtag or media platform?” You are given the choices of saving your friends lives, starting a labor movement, preventing war, or saving your building. I choose to click on saving your friends lives. It then goes into a few videos of multiple people all over the world explaining the movements they started related to this cause. After that you are asked a few more questions with the same idea and different videos are shown. I found it challenging to follow at times, but if I wanted to start over or go back to click on a different choice I couldn’t until the end. 

At times the project glitched, but under the “Tech” tab below it explains that you might need to make the screen smaller so it does not glitch. I’m not sure if it’s because it was designed for a smaller screen or if it’s because it’s high tech, but that’s something that also made the storyline challenging to follow. 

**Conclusion**

_Universe Within_ is an interesting project and I really enjoyed exploring the little details of this project. The project was well organized and provided a lot of educational information about the softwares used as well as the ideas used. This is definitely one of my favorite projects I’ve looked at this semester in this course because it was so different and unique. This project helped me look at an alternative perspective of how Digital Humanities can be defined and shown through a project.
