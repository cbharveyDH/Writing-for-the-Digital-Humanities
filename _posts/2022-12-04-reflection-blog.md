## Reflection Blog
### by Claire Harvey 

As the semester comes to an end, I enjoy taking the time to reflect on my accomplishments and challenges within all of my classes.
Being a student in the class Writing for Digital Humanities has made me a better writer, reader, and student. 

Throughout this course we were given multiple writing assignments as well as challenging readings. Digital Humanities (DH) is already a difficult topic to define, but my personal definition of DH is “the digital study of humanistic behaviors.” I remember reading that in an article from my Introduction to Digital Humanities class last year and it has stuck with me. That’s probably the most simple way of defining DH. 

The readings from this semester also opened my eyes to other definitions of the study, but they were challenging to understand at times. I would usually have to read the readings a few times in order to grasp the concept due to DH being difficult to define. I really enjoyed reading the article “Text Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence” by Kara Pernice. The article discusses four reading patterns (F-Pattern, Spotted Pattern, Layer-Cake Scanning Pattern, and Commitment Pattern) that people use to scan text when looking at digital readings. This was really helpful when I was adjusting my writing skills to a blog format because it focuses on how users chose to skip or read the content they are reading.

The image above is one of the reading patterns I tend to use, which is the Spotted Pattern. This means that certain texts stand out to me because they have different styles like links or words are colored differently. 

I also really enjoyed exploring other platforms, like GitHub. GitHub was a learning curve for me, but luckily our professor provided us with resources and tutorials that would help us navigate the website. Using this platform also allowed me to adjust my writing style and learn how to use my coding skills to my advantage. For this class, we have written a total of 4 blogs on this platform. The first blog being an introduction about myself, the next two were review blogs on DH projects, and this one being the last blog. 

One of my key takeaways from this course was how to write a grant proposal. This is such an important skill for future work after I graduate. I worked with another student in the class on our grant proposal, but the DH project we created is something I would really like to continue in the future. Our project consisted of creating an interactive documentary about Betty Perkinson, an 80 year old woman diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. The documentary is viewed in the form of a virtual photo album where viewers will be taken through Betty’s life from the beginning, time of her diagnosis, to present. The goal of our project is to raise awareness of Alzheimier’s disease and to educate viewers about the effects of the disease. 

Below is an example of how our project would potentially look:

In class we had to write Review Blogs on DH projects we had researched. I found the second review blog to be more beneficial because I chose a project that had more relation to my grant proposal topic. The project I chose was called “The Universe Within”, which you can read more about this project through my GitHub account. I really enjoyed reviewing this specific project because it provided me with tools that would help me with my grant proposal, such as what digital platforms I would need to use for my interactive documentary project.

Overall I found this course to provide me with skills that I can use in my future and made me become a better writer, reader, and student.
